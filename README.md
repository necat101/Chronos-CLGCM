# Chronos v0.5.2 (alpha): A Hybrid Memory-Reasoning Architecture

A novel AI architecture that synergistically integrates Google's Titans memory system with a Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) to move beyond the limitations of scale and take a decisive step on the path to AGI.

-----

### üì¢ **Major Update in v0.5: Enhanced Reasoning & Structured Memory**

> This version introduces two major architectural upgrades that work in tandem to create a more powerful and efficient cognitive process.
>
> 1.  **Adaptive Reasoning Depth ("Ponder Time"):** Chronos can now **"think longer" for harder problems**. The fixed-step reasoning loop has been replaced with a dynamic mechanism where the model learns to decide when it's confident enough to stop reasoning. This makes the model both more powerful and more efficient, better emulating the variable effort of human thought.
>
> 2.  **Structured & Queryable Long-Term Memory:** The LTM is no longer just an associative memory. Each memory slot is now **augmented with metadata, including a timestamp and a source identifier**. This allows the model‚Äîand the user‚Äîto perform sophisticated, context-aware queries, such as retrieving only memories learned from user interaction within the last hour. This brings the "Chronos" name to life.

## About The Project

The field of AI has been dominated by a paradigm of unprecedented scale, yet fundamental limitations in today's Transformer models are becoming apparent. The path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may not be paved with scale alone. Chronos challenges this paradigm by focusing on **architectural intelligence**.

This project introduces a novel hybrid model where a deep reasoning engine operates within a dynamic, lifelong learning memory environment. Chronos is conceived not merely to process information, but to **think, learn, and remember** in a cohesive, integrated, and human-like manner.

## Core Concepts

Chronos is built on two revolutionary, brain-inspired pillars:

üß† **Titans Architecture (The Cognitive Substrate)**
A sophisticated, multi-tiered memory workspace that enables dynamic, lifelong learning. It learns *what to remember* based on the principle of "surprise," and its memory slots are now structured with timestamps and source metadata, allowing for sophisticated, context-aware queries.

‚öôÔ∏è **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (The Cognitive Process)**
A powerful, data-efficient, and deep reasoning engine. Its dual-module design (a high-level "CEO" and low-level "Workers") allows for profound computational depth, enabling it to solve complex, multi-step algorithmic problems where massive LLMs fail.

## Features

  - ü§î **Adaptive "Ponder" Time**: Dynamically adjusts its reasoning depth, "thinking" longer for complex problems and saving computation on simpler ones.
  - üï∞Ô∏è **Structured & Queryable Memory**: LTM slots are augmented with timestamps and source data, enabling powerful temporal and contextual queries during chat.
  - üß† **Dynamic "Online" Learning**: Learns from experience during chat with a Cosine Annealing LR schedule by default for more stable knowledge consolidation.
  - ‚ö° **Accelerated Training with AMP**: Supports Automatic Mixed Precision (`--amp`) for faster training and reduced memory usage on compatible NVIDIA GPUs.
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Stable Training**: Built-in gradient clipping to prevent model instability and ensure smoother convergence.
  - üì¶ **Self-Contained & Portable Models**: Models are saved as directories containing weights, tokenizer, and architecture config for easy sharing and use.
  - üíæ **Automatic Re-quantization**: After a learning session, Chronos can automatically re-quantize a model to persist the new knowledge.
  - üå± **Enhanced Model Expansion**: Includes `expand_model.py` script to transplant weights from smaller models to larger ones, now supporting changes in `max_length` and automatic length detection from datasets.
  - ‚ö° **High-Performance Inference**: Utilizes a custom C++ kernel inspired by `llama.cpp` for state-of-the-art quantization (`INT4`, `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q2_K`).
  - üíª **CPU & GPU Support**: Runs fast quantized inference on standard CPUs (with AVX) or on GPUs via Vulkan for broad hardware compatibility.
  - üîß **Comprehensive Tooling**: Includes a single script (`chronos.py`) for training, LoRA fine-tuning, merging, quantization, and interactive chat, plus the model expansion script.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8+
  - A C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC on Windows, GCC on Linux)
  - CMake (must be available in your system's `PATH`)
  - **For GPU Inference**: A Vulkan-compatible GPU and installed drivers.
  - **For GPU Training (AMP)**: An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Compute Capability 7.0+ recommended for best performance) and a PyTorch build with CUDA enabled.
  - **For Developers (Re-compiling the Kernel)**: The official [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) must be installed to compile the kernel with Vulkan support.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chronos.git
    cd Chronos
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
    # On Linux/macOS
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Run the setup script:** This will install Python dependencies and compile the C++ inference kernel.

    ```bash
    # On Windows
    setup.bat
    # On Linux/macOS
    bash setup.sh
    ```

    This will create a `chronos_matmul` library file in your project root. If this fails, you can try running `pip install .` from the project root.

## üìö User Guide: Step-by-Step Workflows

The `chronos.py` script is the main entry point for most operations. The `expand_model.py` script handles weight transplantation. All models are handled as directories.

### Basic Workflow (`chronos.py`)

1.  **Training:** Train a new model from scratch. This creates a new, self-contained model directory at `--out-dir`. The `--max_h_steps` defines the upper limit for the model's reasoning depth.

    ```bash
    python chronos.py train \
        --train "path/to/your_data.jsonl" \
        --tokenizer-path "microsoft/phi-2" \
        --out-dir "./my_chronos_model" \
        --epochs 5 \
        --batch_size 2 \
        --context_dim 512 \
        --max_h_steps 10 \
        --ponder-loss-weight 0.01 \
        --grad-clip 1.0
    ```

    -----

    üí° **Accelerating Training with AMP (NVIDIA GPUs):**
    If you are training on an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Tensor Cores recommended, e.g., Volta, Turing, Ampere architecture or newer), you can enable **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)** using the `--amp` flag. AMP uses faster, lower-precision `float16` for many computations while maintaining model accuracy, significantly speeding up training and reducing VRAM usage.

    ```bash
    # Example training command with AMP enabled:
    python chronos.py train \
        --train "path/to/your_data.jsonl" \
        --tokenizer-path "microsoft/phi-2" \
        --out-dir "./my_chronos_model_amp" \
        --epochs 5 \
        --batch_size 4 `# You can often increase batch size with AMP` \
        --context_dim 512 \
        --max_h_steps 10 \
        --ponder-loss-weight 0.01 \
        --grad-clip 1.0 \
        --amp # <-- Enable Mixed Precision
    ```

    Make sure your PyTorch installation includes CUDA support. If AMP is requested but CUDA is unavailable, it will be automatically disabled with a warning.

    -----

2.  **Fine-Tuning (LoRA):** Adapt a pre-trained model using LoRA. This loads a full model directory and saves the adapter to a separate output directory. You can also use `--amp` here for faster fine-tuning on GPUs.

    ```bash
    python chronos.py finetune \
        --model-path "./my_chronos_model" \
        --train "path/to/new_data.jsonl" \
        --out-dir "./my_lora_adapter" \
        --epochs 3 \
        --amp # <-- Optionally enable AMP for fine-tuning
    ```

3.  **Merging a LoRA Adapter:** Merge the adapter back into the base model to create a new, standalone model directory.

    ```bash
    python chronos.py merge-lora \
        --model-path "./my_chronos_model" \
        --lora-adapter-path "./my_lora_adapter" \
        --out-dir "./my_model_merged"
    ```

4.  **Quantization:** Convert a full-precision model directory into a quantized model directory. **No architecture flags are needed\!**

    ```bash
    python chronos.py quantize \
        --model-path "./my_model_merged" \
        --out-dir "./my_model_merged-INT4" \
        --qtype INT4
    ```

    > **Available `qtype`:** `INT4`, `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q2_K`.

5.  **Inference (Chat Mode):** Run an interactive chat session by pointing to any model directory.

    ```bash
    python chronos.py chat \
        --model-path "./my_model_merged-INT4"
    ```

### Resuming Training with Modified Learning Rate

If you need to resume training from a checkpoint but want to **change the learning rate schedule** (e.g., start with a different maximum LR or use a different minimum LR), use the `--override-scheduling` flag along with your new `--starting-lr` and `--min-lr` values.

```bash
python chronos.py train \
    --train "path/to/your_data.jsonl" \
    --out-dir "./my_chronos_model" \
    --epochs 10 \
    --resume-from-ckpt "./my_chronos_model/chronos_epoch_5.pt" \
    --starting-lr 1e-5 \
    --min-lr 1e-7 \
    --override-scheduling \
    --amp # <-- Remember AMP if resuming an AMP session
```

> **Warning:** Without `--override-scheduling`, any new LR flags will be **ignored** when resuming, and the schedule from the checkpoint will be used.

### Expanding a Trained Model (`expand_model.py`) üå±

You can efficiently create a larger model by **transplanting the weights** from a smaller, already-trained Chronos model directory. This initializes the larger model with the learned knowledge, potentially leading to faster convergence during subsequent training or fine-tuning. This script can now also expand the model's maximum sequence length (`max_length`).

1.  **Train a smaller base model** (e.g., with `--context_dim 512`, `--max_length 1024`) using `chronos.py`.

2.  **Use `expand_model.py` to create a larger model directory**.

      * Specify the path to the trained smaller model *directory* (`--old-model-path`).
      * Specify the desired output *directory* for the new model (`--output-dir`).
      * Provide any **new, larger architecture dimensions** (e.g., `--context_dim 1024`).
      * Optionally, specify a **new maximum sequence length** (`--new-max-length`) OR let the script **automatically detect** it from a dataset (`--auto-max-length --dataset-for-length path/to/dataset.jsonl`).

    **Example:** Expanding dimensions and `max_length` (automatically detected):

    ```bash
    python expand_model.py \
        --old-model-path "./small_model_dir" \
        --output-dir "./large_model_dir" \
        --context_dim 1024 \
        --h_hidden 1024 \
        --l_hidden 1024 \
        --auto-max-length \
        --dataset-for-length "./larger_dataset.jsonl"
    ```

    **Example:** Expanding `max_length` only (manually set):

    ```bash
    python expand_model.py \
        --old-model-path "./small_model_dir" \
        --output-dir "./long_context_model_dir" \
        --new-max-length 4096
    ```

    The script copies matching weights, correctly handles positional embeddings for the new `max_length`, initializes new parameters randomly, and copies the tokenizer files to the output directory.

3.  **Fine-tune or continue training the expanded model** using `chronos.py`, pointing to the new model directory (`./large_model_dir` or `./long_context_model_dir` in the examples). Remember to use `--amp` if desired for this phase.

### Chat Mode Features (`chronos.py`)

#### Querying Structured Memory

During a chat session, use the `/filter` command to constrain the model's memory retrieval:

  - **Filter by time:**

    ```
    >>> /filter time=-3600
    [INFO: Memory filtered to events after Sat Oct 18 03:02:16 2025]
    ```

    (Only use memories learned in the last hour)

  - **Filter by source:**

    ```
    >>> /filter source=1
    [INFO: Memory filtered to source ID: 1]
    ```

    (Only use memories learned from `user interaction` - Source ID 1. Source ID 2 is `training data`).

  - **Reset filters:**

    ```
    >>> /filter reset
    [INFO: Memory filters have been reset.]
    ```

#### Enabling Online Learning in Chat

Requires the quantized model (`--model-path`) and the original full-precision model (`--shadow-model-path`). You can also use `--amp` here if learning on a CUDA device.

```bash
python chronos.py chat \
    --model-path "./my_model_merged-INT4" \
    --enable-quantized-learning \
    --shadow-model-path "./my_model_merged" \
    --amp # <-- Optionally enable AMP for faster online learning calculations
```

## Changelog


### v0.5.2 (alpha)

  - **Enhanced `expand_model.py` Script**:
      - Added ability to expand `max_length` by correctly handling positional embeddings.
      - Added `--new-max-length` flag for manual specification.
      - Added `--auto-max-length` and `--dataset-for-length` flags to automatically detect required `max_length` from a dataset.
      - Automatically copies tokenizer files to the expanded model directory.
  - **Documentation**: Updated README with detailed usage for the enhanced `expand_model.py`.
  - **Enhanced NVIDIA hardware acceleration**: Implemented "Automatic Mixed Precision" support to accelerate training speed on powerful Ampere NVIDIA GPUs or newer.

### v0.5.1 (alpha)

  - **Added `--override-scheduling` flag**: Allows users to force new learning rate schedule settings (`--starting-lr`, `--min-lr`) when resuming training from a checkpoint.
  - **Documentation**: Added usage instructions for `--override-scheduling`.

### v0.5 (alpha)

  - **Implemented Structured Long-Term Memory**: Memory slots are now augmented with timestamps and source metadata, enabling temporal and source-based filtering during chat.
  - **Implemented Adaptive Reasoning Depth (Ponder Time)**: The HRM's reasoning depth is now dynamic. The model learns to "think longer" for complex tokens and halt early on simple ones.
  - **Added Ponder Cost**: A new auxiliary loss (`--ponder-loss-weight`) trains the model to be computationally efficient.
  - **Added Halting Threshold**: A new inference flag (`--h-halt-thresh`) allows users to control the trade-off between speed and reasoning depth during chat.

### v0.4 (alpha)

  - **Implemented Dynamic LTM Learning Rate**: Online learning now defaults to a `CosineAnnealingLR` schedule for more stable knowledge consolidation.
  - **Added Static LR Fallback**: The `--static-ltm-lr` flag can be used in chat mode to revert to a fixed LTM learning rate.
  - **Added Gradient Clipping**: The `--grad-clip` argument was added to `train` and `finetune` modes to improve training stability.
