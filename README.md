# Chronos v0.5 (alpha): A Hybrid Memory-Reasoning Architecture

A novel AI architecture that synergistically integrates Google's Titans memory system with a Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) to move beyond the limitations of scale and take a decisive step on the path to AGI.

-----

### üì¢ **Major Update in v0.5: Enhanced Reasoning & Structured Memory**

> This version introduces two major architectural upgrades that work in tandem to create a more powerful and efficient cognitive process.
>
> 1.  **Adaptive Reasoning Depth ("Ponder Time"):** Chronos can now **"think longer" for harder problems**. The fixed-step reasoning loop has been replaced with a dynamic mechanism where the model learns to decide when it's confident enough to stop reasoning. This makes the model both more powerful and more efficient, better emulating the variable effort of human thought.
>
> 2.  **Structured & Queryable Long-Term Memory:** The LTM is no longer just an associative memory. Each memory slot is now **augmented with metadata, including a timestamp and a source identifier**. This allows the model‚Äîand the user‚Äîto perform sophisticated, context-aware queries, such as retrieving only memories learned from user interaction within the last hour. This brings the "Chronos" name to life.

## About The Project

The field of AI has been dominated by a paradigm of unprecedented scale, yet fundamental limitations in today's Transformer models are becoming apparent. The path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) may not be paved with scale alone. Chronos challenges this paradigm by focusing on **architectural intelligence**.

This project introduces a novel hybrid model where a deep reasoning engine operates within a dynamic, lifelong learning memory environment. Chronos is conceived not merely to process information, but to **think, learn, and remember** in a cohesive, integrated, and human-like manner.

## Core Concepts

Chronos is built on two revolutionary, brain-inspired pillars:

üß† **Titans Architecture (The Cognitive Substrate)**
A sophisticated, multi-tiered memory workspace that enables dynamic, lifelong learning. It learns *what to remember* based on the principle of "surprise," and its memory slots are now structured with timestamps and source metadata, allowing for sophisticated, context-aware queries.

‚öôÔ∏è **Hierarchical Reasoning Model (The Cognitive Process)**
A powerful, data-efficient, and deep reasoning engine. Its dual-module design (a high-level "CEO" and low-level "Workers") allows for profound computational depth, enabling it to solve complex, multi-step algorithmic problems where massive LLMs fail.

## Features

  - ü§î **Adaptive "Ponder" Time**: Dynamically adjusts its reasoning depth, "thinking" longer for complex problems and saving computation on simpler ones.
  - üï∞Ô∏è **Structured & Queryable Memory**: LTM slots are augmented with timestamps and source data, enabling powerful temporal and contextual queries during chat.
  - üß† **Dynamic "Online" Learning**: Learns from experience during chat with a Cosine Annealing LR schedule by default for more stable knowledge consolidation.
  - üõ°Ô∏è **Stable Training**: Built-in gradient clipping to prevent model instability and ensure smoother convergence.
  - üì¶ **Self-Contained & Portable Models**: Models are saved as directories containing weights, tokenizer, and architecture config for easy sharing and use.
  - üíæ **Automatic Re-quantization**: After a learning session, Chronos can automatically re-quantize a model to persist the new knowledge.
  - ‚ö° **High-Performance Inference**: Utilizes a custom C++ kernel inspired by `llama.cpp` for state-of-the-art quantization (`INT4`, `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q2_K`).
  - üíª **CPU & GPU Support**: Runs fast quantized inference on standard CPUs (with AVX) or on GPUs via Vulkan for broad hardware compatibility.
  - üîß **Comprehensive Tooling**: Includes a single, powerful script for training, LoRA fine-tuning, merging, quantization, and interactive chat.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8+
  - A C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC on Windows, GCC on Linux)
  - CMake (must be available in your system's `PATH`)
  - **For GPU Inference**: A Vulkan-compatible GPU and installed drivers.
  - **For Developers (Re-compiling the Kernel)**: The official [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) must be installed to compile the kernel with Vulkan support.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chronos.git
    cd Chronos
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
    # On Linux/macOS
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Run the setup script:** This will install Python dependencies and compile the C++ inference kernel.

    ```bash
    # On Windows
    setup.bat
    # On Linux/macOS
    bash setup.sh
    ```

    This will create a `chronos_matmul` library file in your project root. If this fails, you can try running `pip install .` from the project root.

## üìö User Guide: A Step-by-Step Workflow

The `chronos.py` script is the main entry point for all operations. All models are now handled as directories.

### 1\. Training

Train a new model from scratch. This creates a new, self-contained model directory at `--out-dir`. The `--max_h_steps` defines the upper limit for the model's reasoning depth.

```bash
python chronos.py train \
    --train "path/to/your_data.jsonl" \
    --tokenizer-path "microsoft/phi-2" \
    --out-dir "./my_chronos_model" \
    --epochs 5 \
    --batch_size 2 \
    --context_dim 512 \
    --max_h_steps 10 \
    --ponder-loss-weight 0.01 \
    --grad-clip 1.0
```

### 2\. Fine-Tuning (LoRA)

Adapt a pre-trained model using LoRA. This loads a full model directory and saves the adapter to a separate output directory.

```bash
python chronos.py finetune \
    --model-path "./my_chronos_model" \
    --train "path/to/new_data.jsonl" \
    --out-dir "./my_lora_adapter" \
    --epochs 3
```

### 3\. Merging a LoRA Adapter

Merge the adapter back into the base model to create a new, standalone model directory.

```bash
python chronos.py merge-lora \
    --model-path "./my_chronos_model" \
    --lora-adapter-path "./my_lora_adapter" \
    --out-dir "./my_model_merged"
```

### 4\. Quantization

Convert a full-precision model directory into a quantized model directory. **No architecture flags are needed\!**

```bash
python chronos.py quantize \
    --model-path "./my_model_merged" \
    --out-dir "./my_model_merged-INT4" \
    --qtype INT4
```

> **Available `qtype`:** `INT4`, `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q2_K`.

### 5\. Inference (Chat Mode)

Run an interactive chat session by pointing to any model directory.

```bash
python chronos.py chat \
    --model-path "./my_model_merged-INT4"
```

#### Querying Structured Memory

During a chat session, you can use the `/filter` command to constrain the model's memory retrieval for its next response.

  - **Filter by time:**

    ```
    >>> /filter time=-3600
    [INFO: Memory filtered to events after Fri Oct 17 01:45:00 2025]
    ```

    This command tells Chronos to only use memories it has learned in the last hour (3600 seconds).

  - **Filter by source:**

    ```
    >>> /filter source=1
    [INFO: Memory filtered to source ID: 1]
    ```

    This tells Chronos to only use memories learned from `user interaction` (Source ID 1).

  - **Reset filters:**

    ```
    >>> /filter reset
    [INFO: Memory filters have been reset.]
    ```

#### Enabling Online Learning in Chat

This requires both the quantized model (`--model-path`) and the original full-precision model (`--shadow-model-path`) to calculate the updates.

```bash
python chronos.py chat \
    --model-path "./my_model_merged-INT4" \
    --enable-quantized-learning \
    --shadow-model-path "./my_model_merged"
```
